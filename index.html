<section>   <h2>Project Example #1: <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/apps/instruction/evidence-based-practice/#/">Evidence-Based Practice</a> </h2> <p>This tutorial is a collaboration between the Instructional Design Team and the Health Science Librarians. </p><h3>Why</h3><p> I included this tutorial because it is built without using a rapid e-learning tool - instead we wanted to take an innovative approach and used reveal.js and Qualtrics. It is responsive and accessible. In our peer institutions, very few library tutorials are being built without rapid e-learning tools like Captivate or Storyline. We take the time to revist this content each year because this tutorial and its predecessors are the top-viewed tutorial from the Libraries with an average of 1000 views each month. We want to make sure our content is current and accessible to our users - thus the move to a more accessible technology. </p> <h3>Unique Contribution</h3><p>My contribution to the project was taking the lead on project management and instructional design, investigating creation tools, creating the CSS and HTML, and co-developing the assessment in Qualtrics.

<h2> Project Example #2: 
<a href="http://lihuma.dash.umn.edu/Scalar/source-authority/index">Source Authority</a></h2> <p>This is a work-in-progress developed using Scalar and Timeline.js to teach beginning level information literacy competencies to our students. The concepts in this tutorial are also a piece of the online curriculum we are currently developing in the Libraries. The idea for the project is based off of an in-person activity created by librarians at the University of Virginia.
<h3>Why</h3> I included this because libraries are not typically using digital humanities tools this way - they tend to use them for exhibits rather than instruction. I chose digital humanities tools for this project as a proof of concept to identify if we could incorporate more of these tools into our instructional design toolkit. I think it is important to branch out from the usual tools in online learning to develop new skills.
<h3> Unique Contribution </h3> My contribution to this project is the project management, choosing the technology, instructional design leadership and organizing the content contributions from library staff.

<h2> Project Example #3: <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/apps/instruction/acethejobsearch/"> Ace the Job Search </a> </h2>
This tutorial was a collaboration between the instructional design team and three liaison librarians. We took the concepts from an in-person workshop and translated it to an online module. 
<h3>Why</h3> I didn't just include this tutorial because it won an award through PRIMO: Peer-Reviewed Instruction Materials Online, but because it was our first foray into doing a more active online learning object. Originally, the content experts wanted a video explaining how to use each of the sources - without having students engage with the content. The case study approach with the six different students is something that was not done at the time in online library instruction. <p>

<h3>Unique Contribution</h3>
Though creating this tutorial was truly a partnership with my colleague Andrew and I, my primary role was designing the interface in Articulate Storyline, the instructional design of the project and the project management.
